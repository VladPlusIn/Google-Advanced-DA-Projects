# Introduction
This project performs an exploratory analysis of an HR dataset, employing data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models for predicting employee turnover.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models and evaluating them.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pickle**: For saving models.

## Tasks Performed

### Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Data loading and initial examination.
- Renaming columns for consistency.
- Checking missing values and duplicates.
- Outlier detection and treatment.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizing relationships between various factors (e.g., working hours, satisfaction, number of projects) and employee turnover.
- Identifying patterns and insights related to employee departure and satisfaction levels.
- Correlation analysis among different features.

### Model Building
- Utilizing decision tree and random forest classifiers.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Feature engineering to improve model performance.

### Model Evaluation
- Assessing model performance using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).
- Generating confusion matrices for model evaluation.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Excessive workload and its impact on attrition rates.
- Recommendations to address employee retention issues, such as workload limitations, policy reassessment, and cultural discussions.

## Further Steps
- Investigating potential data leakage by assessing model predictions after removing specific features.
- Refining models based on further analysis.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the importance of workload management and policy revisions to improve employee retention.
